# Mapping_Earthquakes
### Explain the purpose of this analysis:
We are creating a map of earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth,and also all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map.
First, added tectonic plate data using d3.json(), and then we added the data using the geoJSON() layer, set the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map, and finally added the tectonic plate data to the overlay object with the earthquake data.

### Datasource
GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json from github resources

### Results: 
 .Created maps using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes. 

 .The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color.
 
 .Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color
  Popups that provide additional information about the earthquake were included when a marker is clicked

 .A legend was created to provide context for the map data
